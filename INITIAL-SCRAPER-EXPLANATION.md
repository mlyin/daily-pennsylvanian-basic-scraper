# Initial Scraper Explanation

## Overview
The current scraper is designed to collect the main headline from The Daily Pennsylvanian's homepage. It runs once per day and stores the results in a JSON file that tracks headlines over time.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Scraping Function (`scrape_data_point()`)
- Makes a GET request to https://www.thedp.com
- Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML
- Looks for an `<a>` tag with class "frontpage-link"
- Extracts the text content of this link, which is the main headline
- Returns an empty string if no headline is found

### 2. Data Storage
- Uses a `DailyEventMonitor` class to manage data storage
- Data is saved in `data/daily_pennsylvanian_headlines.json`
- Each data point includes:
  - Timestamp of when the headline was scraped
  - The headline text itself

### 3. Logging
- Uses the `loguru` library for comprehensive logging
- Logs are rotated daily
- Tracks:
  - Request URLs and status codes
  - Scraped data points
  - File operations
  - Any errors that occur

### 4. Error Handling
- Gracefully handles failures in:
  - Directory creation
  - Web scraping
  - Data saving
- Continues execution even if some operations fail

### 5. File Structure
The scraper maintains a clean directory structure:
- `data/` - Contains the JSON file with scraped headlines
- `scrape.log` - Contains daily logs of scraping operations

## Data Format
The scraped data is stored in a JSON format that looks like:
```json
{
  "2024-3-3": [
    ["2024-03-03 01:41PM", "Headline text here"]
  ],
  "2024-3-4": [
    ["2024-03-04 03:02PM", "Headline text here"]
  ]
}
```

This structure allows for:
- Daily tracking of headlines
- Multiple headlines per day (though currently only one is collected)
- Timestamp tracking for each headline

## Limitations of Current Implementation
1. Only scrapes the main headline
2. Doesn't capture section-specific headlines
3. Doesn't collect metadata about the articles
4. Doesn't handle multiple headlines from different sections
