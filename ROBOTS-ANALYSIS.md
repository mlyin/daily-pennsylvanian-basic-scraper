# Robots Analysis for the Daily Pennsylvanian

The Daily Pennsylvanian's `robots.txt` file is available at
[https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt](https://www.thedp.com/robots.txt).

## Contents of the `robots.txt` file on March 19, 2024

```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

The robots.txt file for the Daily Pennsylvanian is quite permissive and straightforward:

1. For all web crawlers (`User-agent: *`):
   - A crawl delay of 10 seconds is specified, meaning crawlers should wait at least 10 seconds between requests
   - All paths are explicitly allowed (`Allow: /`)

2. For SemrushBot specifically:
   - All access is disallowed (`Disallow: /`)

This configuration is very favorable for our scraping project because:
- It explicitly allows crawling of the entire site
- The 10-second crawl delay is reasonable for our use case since we're only scraping once per day
- The only restriction is on SemrushBot, which doesn't affect our scraper

Our planned scraping approach (once per day) well exceeds the crawl delay requirement of 10 seconds, so we are fully compliant with the robots.txt directives.
