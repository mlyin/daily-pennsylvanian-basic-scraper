# GitHub Actions Schedule Explanation

## Current Schedule

The current cron expression in our GitHub Actions workflow is:
```
0 20 * * *
```

## Cron Syntax Explanation

This cron expression means our scraper runs at 20:00 UTC (8:00 PM UTC) every day. Let's break down the five fields:

1. **Minute (0)**: The first field represents minutes (0-59). In our case, `0` means the job runs at the start of the hour.

2. **Hour (20)**: The second field represents hours in 24-hour format (0-23). `20` corresponds to 8:00 PM UTC.

3. **Day of Month (*)**: The third field represents the day of the month (1-31). The asterisk `*` means "every day of the month."

4. **Month (*)**: The fourth field represents the month (1-12). The asterisk `*` means "every month."

5. **Day of Week (*)**: The fifth field represents the day of the week (0-6, where 0 is Sunday). The asterisk `*` means "every day of the week."

## Schedule Considerations

For our Daily Pennsylvanian headline scraper, running once per day at 8:00 PM UTC is appropriate because:

1. It aligns with typical news publication cycles
2. It provides a consistent daily snapshot of headlines
3. It respects the website's resources by not making too frequent requests
4. It ensures we capture the day's most important headlines

## Modifying the Schedule

If you want to run the scraper twice per day, you could modify the cron expression to:
```
0 8,20 * * *
```

This would run the scraper at 8:00 AM UTC and 8:00 PM UTC every day.

## Robustness Requirements

To ensure the scraper works reliably for the remainder of the semester:

1. **Monitor GitHub Actions logs** regularly to detect any failures
2. **Debug and fix issues** promptly when they occur
3. **Test changes locally** before pushing to the repository
4. **Document any modifications** to the scraper or schedule
5. **Ensure data continuity** by maintaining the JSON file structure
